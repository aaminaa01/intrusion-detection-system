This project is a dummy intrusion detection system. It uses a combination of proximity and touch sensors to trigger the capturing of images of the (possible) intruder, which are then classified by the facial recognition module running on a remote server. The data generated is logged for long-term analysis and visualisation, and intrusion notifications are sent via the Blynk mobile app.
This repository contains:
- Arduino code for an ESP32 microcontroller
- Code for Apache Superset data visualization
- Code for the facial recognition module
